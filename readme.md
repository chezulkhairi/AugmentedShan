# Augmented Shanahan

This is an in-browser virtual reality application that uses the features of the Shanahan building as markers. 

The augmented reality works on non-iOS devices with a back-facing camera and a modern browser (tested in Chrome and Firefox), but you have to physically be in the Shanahan building at Harvey Mudd College to get the full effect. Denying camera access or accessing it on an incompatible device will use a static image of the building instead of using the device camera as the input source. Works best in evenly-lit conditions. Image quality and detection may be slightly better in Firefox than Chrome, which doesn't autofocus very well.
